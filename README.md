# Felucca

[![License: GPL-3.0-only](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--3.0--only-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Felucca is open-source custom synthesizer firmware for the **M-VAVE FM-1**.

The FM-1 is the only supported hardware target. This project does not provide, maintain, or accept requests for ports to other devices or software platforms.

## Install

**Stable release: 1.8.1.** Connect your FM-1 by USB and use the [web installer](https://hugelton.github.io/Felucca/) in Chrome or Edge. The installer offers a way back to the official V15 firmware. Back up your projects and presets before changing firmware.

**Newer FM-1 flash: 1.8.2 beta.** Some newer FM-1 units use UC25HQ80 flash (JEDEC ID `0xB36014`). [1.8.2-beta](https://github.com/hugelton/Felucca/releases/tag/v1.8.2-beta) adds recognition for that chip; testing on the revised hardware is still pending. See [issue #320](https://github.com/hugelton/Felucca/issues/320). It is not the stable release.

The firmware uses [Felucca-Engines](https://github.com/hugelton/Felucca-Engines) (MIT) for its built-in sound engines and [felucca-bsp](https://github.com/hugelton/felucca-bsp) (MPL-2.0) for the FM-1 hardware layer. Neither repository implies support for Felucca on other hardware.

## Development and support

Felucca focuses on the FM-1. Third-party modifications and ports are independent projects and are not tested or supported here. Contributions are considered at the maintainer's discretion; no development schedule or ongoing support is promised.

Felucca is developed with the assistance of AI coding agents (code, tests, documentation, translation, maintenance). Design, features, sounds and direction are the maintainer's or the community's; no generative AI is used for music, icons or artwork. See [On AI-Assisted Development and Responsibility](https://github.com/hugelton/Felucca/discussions/166).

## Credits and licence

Felucca is free software under [GPL-3.0-only](LICENSE); the Hügelton Sample Pack is CC0 1.0. The engines and hardware layer retain their own licences. See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) and [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md).
